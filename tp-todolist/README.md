# TodoList

This is a TodoList we had as a project for our nodeJS courses. This was the last project. We managed to learn a lot of things doing this project and it has made us even more interested in our studies.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To install our TodoList clone 

```
https://github.com/VernerBoisson/todolist.git
```
in the wanted directory.

Then use the commande ``` cd ``` to go into the todolist directory.

By using the command

```
npm install
```

in the cloned directory you will have completed the installation.

## Running the tests 

You can now do 

``` 
node express.js
```

to start the server.

then you simply go to 

``` 
localhost:8080
```

and it should work.

We wanted to do a lot more than that, right now there is no timeout on the session, we also wanted to create admin roles, but we weren't able to do that, so right we only see our own todos, and to see other peoples todos we have to go on their profile.

### Thank you for your time :)
